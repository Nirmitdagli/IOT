As an essential constituent of many associationsâ€™ security and safety precedence, video
surveillance has established its importance and benefits numerous times by providing
immediate supervising of possessions, people, environment and property. This project deals
with the design approach of an Embedded Real-Time Surveillance System Based Raspberry Pi
SBC for intruder detection that reinforces surveillance technology to provide essential security
to our life and associated control and alert operations.

The proposed security solution hinges on our novel integration of cameras and motion detectors
into web application. Raspberry Pi operates and controls motion detectors and video cameras
for remote sensing and surveillance, streams live video and records it for future playback. This
research is focused on developing a surveillance system that detects strangers and to response
speedily by capturing and relaying images to owner based wireless module.
This Raspberry Pi based Smart Surveillance System presents the idea of monitoring a particular
place in a remote area. The proposed solution offers a cost effective ubiquitous surveillance
solution, efficient and easy to implement.

This project will also present the idea of motion detection and tracking using image processing.
This type of technology is of great importance when it comes to surveillance and security. Live
video streams will therefore be used to show how objects can be detected then tracked. The
detection and tracking process will be based on pixel threshold.
